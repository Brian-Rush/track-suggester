            <p>
              CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, fonts, and other stylistic choices. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, and printers. HTML — used for building the structure of the page — and CSS — used for the visual layout — are the two basic languages involved in the building of web pages and web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              This CSS course building on the fundamentals from our Introduction to Programming Course. Students who learn CSS will be able to style web pages using complex, responsive layouts, while gaining exposure to the latest CSS tools, tricks, and features used every day by front-end developers and designers.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS programming is an integral part of front-end development. CSS – along with HTML and JavaScript – helps front-end developers control what the user of a website can see and do.
